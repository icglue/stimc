# TODOs
- make test target (with regression of simulations?)
  - add regression
  - add test script
  - make testcases self-checking
  - add more testcases
- provide makefile with system-wide installation?
- consider free-functionality
  - some end-of-simulation callback for modules
  - cleanup coroutines
  - difficult: memory allocated in threads (will be lost if threads are cancelled)
  - maybe: some simplified way of adding frees/deletes as end-of-simulation callbacks
- check what happens in case of simulation $reset
  - are threads restarted?
  - double-invocation of input-sensitive methods?
