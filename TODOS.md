# TODOs
- provide makefile with system-wide installation?
- consider free-functionality
  - some end-of-simulation // before-reset callback for modules + coroutines cleanup
  - difficult: memory allocated in threads (will be lost if threads are cancelled)
  - maybe: some simplified way of adding frees/deletes as end-thread callback
  - for every thread: cleanup callback linked list, user can add callbacks
  - for stimc: cleanup callback list; contains cleanup callbacks for
    - every thread (call cleanup callbacks + delete thread)
    - every method callback (remove callback)
    - nba-callbacks ??? temporary (circular?) doubly-linked-list for cleanup?
    - every module: delete module
    - stimc: remove cleanup callbacks, clean event queue
- check what happens in case of simulation $reset
  - are threads restarted?
  - double-invocation of input-sensitive methods?
