# stimc â€“ a lightweight Verilog-vpi Wrapper for Stimuli Generation

stimc is a lightweight Verilog-vpi wrapper to simplify simulation control via
c/c++ code similar to SystemC.
In contrast to SystemC you can only use stimc together with a Verilog simulator
and it is not meant as a standalone hardware description or modelling language.
The main Purpose is to control and observe ports of an empty Verilog shell-module
via c/c++ code to provide abstract models for external components or emulate functionality
of an external software-based access to a hardware component.

## Usage

### Verilog Shell
The first thing you need is a Verilog shell for a stimc controlled module.
This is a Verilog module with parameters and inputs/outputs and optionally parameters.
The module should have no actual content except for an initial block calling the system task
`$stimc_<modulename>_init();` (with `<modulename>` replaced by the name of the Verilog
module name.
The system task will be defined by stimc and initialize the stimc part of the module.

An example could look like this:
```verilog
module dummy (
    clk_i,
    reset_n_i,
    data_in_i,
    data_out_o
);

    parameter DATA_W = 32;

    input               clk_i;
    input               reset_n_i;
    input  [DATA_W-1:0] data_in_i;
    output [DATA_W-1:0] data_out_o;

    initial begin
        $stimc_dummy_init();
    end

endmodule
```

### stimc Module
stimc core is written in c with a thin c++ wrapper,
so the stimc part of the module can be written in c or c++,
but c++ will produce more readable code and here the c++ version will be explained.

#### Module Class
First a c++ class is needed that inherits `stimcxx_module` (include `stimc++.h`).
For every (used) port of the Verilog shell the class should have a `port` member,
for every (used) parameter a `parameter` member of the same name as the Verilog pendant.
Additionally can have `stimcxx_event` members in case waiting on events triggered
by individual stimc threads or value-change events on ports is needed (similar to
SystemC events).

The class needs a constructor without arguments and can have (non-static) void functions
that can be run as initially started threads (comparable to a Verilog initial block
or a SystemC thread) or port event based in which case they are limited to triggering
events or immediately reacting (similar to SystemC methods).

An excerpt from the project's examples looks like this:
```c++
class dummy : public stimcxx_module {
    private:
        parameter DATA_W;

        port clk_i;
        port reset_n_i;
        port data_in_i;
        port data_out_o;

        stimcxx_event clk_event;

    public:
        dummy ();
        virtual ~dummy ();

        void testcontrol ();
        void clock ();
        void dinchange ();
};
```

#### Constructor
The constructor needs to initialize ports, parameters, event-triggered methods and threads
started at simulation start.
For ports and parameters preprocessor defines are prepared to use in the member initializer list.
For ports this is `STIMCXX_PORT (<port-name>)`, for parameters `STIMCXX_PARAMETER (<parameter-name>)`.
In the constructor threads and event-triggered methods can be setup with the defines
`STIMCXX_REGISTER_STARTUP_THREAD (<function-name>);` and
`STIMCXX_REGISTER_METHOD (<event-type>, <port-name>, <function-name>);`, where `<event-type>` is
one of `posedge`, `negedge` or `change` (corresponding to the Verilog posedge, negedge or just
plain `@` events).

The main part of the example constructor looks like this:
```c++
dummy::dummy () :
    STIMCXX_PARAMETER (DATA_W),
    STIMCXX_PORT (clk_i),
    STIMCXX_PORT (reset_n_i),
    STIMCXX_PORT (data_in_i),
    STIMCXX_PORT (data_out_o)
{
    STIMCXX_REGISTER_STARTUP_THREAD (testcontrol);
    STIMCXX_REGISTER_METHOD (posedge, clk_i, clock);
    STIMCXX_REGISTER_METHOD (change, data_in_i, dinchange);
}
```

On every posedge event on the `clk_i` input the member function `clock` will
be called, on every value change on input `data_in_i` the function `dinchange` will
be called and a stimc thread will be created and run at simulation start calling
`testcontrol`.

#### Initialization
To provide the Verilog initializer system task and functionality
the preprocessor define `STIMCXX_INIT (<module-name>)` (without semi colon)
should be put at some place in the code.

Additionally for compiling the vpi library an inline include file named
`stimc-export.inl` should be provided with lines consisting of calls
to the define `STIMC_EXPORT (<module-name>)` for every module that will
be compiled within the library.

This will provide the system tasks for all modules on loading the vpi library.

#### Functionality
To interact parameters can be read, ports can be read and assigned.
For reading it is possible to directly assign a port or parameter to a variable.
For writing to a port you can assign an integer type to it directly (corresponding
to Verilog blocking assignment) or via the overloaded `<<=` operator (corresponding
to Verilog non-blocking assignment, optical similarity to Verilog is intended,
while risking misinterpretation as shift operation).

In case only a bit-range of a port should be accessed or an integer type is not sufficiently
wide it is possible to access the ports function `bits(<msb>,<lsb>)` and similarly read from
or write to the bit-range.
Ports also have some helpers to set them to `x` or `z` (`set_x()`, `set_z()` and non-blocking
versions `nb_set_x()`, `nb_set_z()`) or check if the value contains `x` or `z` values (`is_xz()`).

Furthermore there are helper functions:
- `time()` (simulation time in seconds), `time(<unit>)` (simulation
  time as integer in specified unit, similar to SystemC units are defined as `SC_PS`, `SC_US` and so on).
- `finish()` to finish simulation.
- `wait(<event>)` to wait on an event to be triggered,
  `wait(<time>)` to wait an amount of time in seconds (double) or
  `wait(<time>,<unit>)` to wait an integral amount of time in specified unit (similarly `SC_PS` and so on).
  The wait function can only be called from within a thread
  (as only initialized threads can be suspended and resumed).

Events can be triggered by calling their `trigger()` member function.
When triggering an event all threads currently waiting for it will be resumed (in any order).
It is not possible for a thread to trigger itself as it would either need to first wait (not being
able to trigger) or first trigger (and not yet waiting on the event, so not being resumed on this
trigger).

### Compiling
For compiling everything (depending on the simulator) you need to build a vpi library
containing the stimc/stimc++ code, the module code and the `stimc-export.c` providing
`stimc-export.inl` containing the modules' export-defines in the include path.

## Examples
Examples are provided in the examples directory.
To use it you need icarus verilog, GTKWave and the portable coroutine library (libpcl) installed
and gcc as compiler.
You can load the project environment by sourcing the `env.sh` in the project examples directory.

The examples provide 2 stimc design units: dummy (the shown dummy) and ff (a stimc flip-flop model).
The Verilog shell can be found in `source/behavioral/verilog`, the module stimc code in
`source/behavioral/stimc`. To run the example simulation enter the units `simulation/iverilog/tc_sanity`
testcase directory and run `make`. The code will be compiled, run and GTKWave will be started
for browsing the simulated waveforms.
